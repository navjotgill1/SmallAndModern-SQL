# SmallAndModern-SQL

This Tool will work with MySQL at localhost and Python.

With PyCharm:

Start the sql server and 

Import the files into PyCharm and with 'app.py' connect to MySQL and create a database and then the table.

Since the connection between the button and sql couldn't be implemented in time, the SQL operations can be executed in the IDE and directly in 'app.py'.

The web.py file can execute and will show a link in the terminal.
